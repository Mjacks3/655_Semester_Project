Hey there. This repository is an upload of a semester long project I worked on alongside two classmates titled "Modeling Electronic Arts's Market Success From Game Data"for our CMSC 655   Numerical Computations class. For our project, we used Python based analytic algorithms to try to disover and  study any correlations from publisher EA's game sales based on as many charactistics of the games that we could compile.
